Hiring a full-time CPO is a big commitment. Here are five signs that fractional might be the better path.

## 1. You're Between $2M and $15M ARR

Too big for founder-led product, too small for a $400K executive. Fractional fills this gap perfectly.

## 2. You Need Strategy, Not Execution

If your team can build but lacks direction, you need a few days per week of senior thinking—not another full-time hire.

## 3. You're Preparing for a Funding Round

Investors want to see product leadership. A fractional CPO can build the narrative and roadmap without the long-term commitment.

## 4. Your Product Team is Struggling

High turnover? Missed deadlines? Sometimes you need an outside perspective to diagnose and fix team issues.

## 5. You're Entering a New Market

New markets need new strategies. Fractional leaders bring cross-industry experience you can't get from one full-time hire.

## The Bottom Line

Fractional isn't a compromise—it's a strategy. The best companies match their leadership model to their stage.
